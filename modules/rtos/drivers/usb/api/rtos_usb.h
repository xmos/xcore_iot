 * \param speed             The speed at which the bus should operate. Either XUD_SPEED_FS or XUD_SPEED_HS. See
 *                          XUD_BusSpeed_t in lib_xud.
 * \param power_source      The source of the device's power. Either bus powered (XUD_PWR_BUS) or self powered
 *                          (XUD_PWR_SELF). See XUD_PwrConfig in lib_xud.
