 * interfere with it. It will also disable preemption on this thread, such that once it
 * is running, no other tasks will be able to interfere with it, even if they have a

 *
 * \note Due to implementation details of lib_xud, it is only possible to have one
 * USB instance per application. Functionally this is not an issue, as no XCore chips
 * have more than one USB interface. For the same reason, there is no need for an init
 * function, as all I/O initialization takes place by lib_xud after the driver instance
 * is started.

 *                          endpoint here includes both its IN and OUT endpoints. For example, if the

 *                          disabled in the two endpoint type lists \p endpoint_out_type and \p endpoint_in_type.
 * \param endpoint_out_type A list of the endpoint types for each output endpoint. Index 0 represents the type
 *                          for EP0_OUT, and so on. See XUD_EpType in lib_xud. If the endpoint is unused, it must
 *                          be set to XUD_EPTYPE_DIS.
 * \param endpoint_in_type  A list of the endpoint types for each input endpoint. Index 0 represents the type
 *                          for EP0_IN, and so on. See XUD_EpType in lib_xud. If the endpoint is unused, it must
 *                          be set to XUD_EPTYPE_DIS.
 * \param speed             The speed at which the bus should operate. Either XUD_SPEED_FS or XUD_SPEED_HS. See
 *                          XUD_BusSpeed_t in lib_xud.
 * \param XUD_PwrConfig     The source of the device's power. Either bus powered (XUD_PWR_BUS) or self powered
