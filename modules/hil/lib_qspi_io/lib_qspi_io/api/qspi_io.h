 * Inputs a byte array from the QSPI interface. The byte array

 *
 * \note The number of bytes input may be any number. However, if
 * it is NOT a multiple of four, then this likely will need to be
 * the last call in the transaction. This is because the shorter
 * length of the last input chunk plus the extra overhead required
 * to deal with the sub-word accesses will not allow subsequent I/O
 * to keep up unless the SCLK frequency is significantly slower than
 * the core clock.
 *
 * \param ctx           Pointer to the QSPI I/O context.
 * \param transfer_mode Can be either qspi_io_transfer_normal or qspi_io_transfer_nibble_swap.
 *                      When qspi_io_transfer_nibble_swap, each byte transferred in is
 *                      nibble swapped. Because the data is inherently received nibble swapped
 *                      over the port, setting this to qspi_io_transfer_nibble_swap
 *                      actually removes a nibble swap operation.
 * \param data          Pointer to the byte array to save the received data to.
 *                      This MUST begin on a 4-byte boundary.
 * \param start_time    The port time, relative to the beginning of the transfer, 
 *                      at which to input the first group of four bytes. This must
 *                      line up with the last nibble of the fourth byte. If \p len
 *                      is less than four, then it must line up with the last nibble
 *                      of the last byte.
