Introduction
************

XCORE-IOT is a collection of C/C++ software libraries designed to simplify and accelerate application development on xcore processors. It is composed of the following components:

- Peripheral IO libraries including; UART, I2C, I2S, SPI, QSPI, PDM microphones, and USB. These libraries support bare-metal and RTOS application development.
- Libraries core to DSP applications, including vectorized math.  These libraries support bare-metal and RTOS application development. 
- Libraries that enable multi-core FreeRTOS development on xcore including a wide array of RTOS drivers and middleware.
- Code Examples - Examples showing a variety of xcore features based on bare-metal and FreeRTOS programming.
- Documentation - Tutorials, references and API guides.

XCORE-IOT is designed to be used in conjunction with the xcore.ai Evaluation Kit (XK-EVK-XU316).  Further information about the xcore.ai Evaluation Kit and xcore.ai devices is available to on `www.xmos.ai <https://www.xmos.ai/>`__.
